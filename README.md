# Planet ThreeJS - A Skylos Experiment

> *"The web shouldn't just be read; it should be explored."*

Welcome to **Planet ThreeJS**. This project is more than just a landing page—it's a statement from the team at **Skylos Solutions**. We believe that the boundary between "website" and "experience" is dissolving, and we built this demo to prove it.

## Why We Built This

At Skylos, we are obsessed with the moment a user pauses and thinks, *"Wow."*

We created this showcase to push our own limits and to inspire the developer community. We wanted to see if we could take a standard marketing layout and transform it into a living, breathing digital world—without sacrificing performance or accessibility.

This repo is our playground for:
*   **Volumetric Design:** Moving beyond flat pixels into deep, point-cloud aesthetics.
*   **Emotional UI:** Using motion and light to guide the user's journey.
*   **Technical Art:** Bridging the gap between creative vision and hard engineering.

## What's Inside

This isn't just a template. It's a collection of our best techniques for:
-   **React Three Fiber:** Managing complex 3D scenes declaratively.
-   **GSAP ScrollTrigger:** Choreographing the 3D world to the user's scroll.
-   **Custom Shaders:** Writing raw GLSL to create performance-cheap, visually expensive effects (like our custom planet halo).

## Join Our Orbit

We are a team of dreamers, engineers, and designers building the next generation of AI and Blockchain interfaces. If this code sparks an idea in you, or if you want to build something impossible together, reach out.
